## Projects
**Interpreter & Compiler in OCaml (Programming Languages Course)**
Spring 2025
- Implemented an interpreter for the imperative language K-, supporting environment-based function calls, memory management, and control flow within OCaml’s runtime
- Built a compiler from K- to the stack-based VM SM5, preserving variable immutability and supporting recursive functions with proper environment binding
- Developed an interpreter for the lambda-based functional language M, including both simple type checking and a let-polymorphic type system
- Translated SM5 bytecode to a simplified VM Sonata, eliminating continuations by encoding return addresses in memory

**Event-Driven HTTP Server in C (Computer Networks Course)**  
Spring 2025  
- Created a simple HTTP 1.1 web server using the epoll API in an event-driven architecture

**Simple TCP stack in C (Computer Networks Course)**  
Spring 2025  
- Implemented a reliable transport protocol on top of an unreliable network layer
- Supported 3-way/4-way handshake, reliable in-order delivery, and connection state transitions
- Designed robust buffering with interval-merge logic, retransmission using Karn-Partridge RTO, and Go-Back-N mechanism

**Simple Router in C (Computer Networks Course)**
Spring 2025
- Built a basic IP router handling ARP, ICMP, TTL, and routing logic
- Implemented packet forwarding with ARP caching and ICMP response generation (Echo Reply, TTL Exceeded, Port Unreachable, etc.)
- Enforced source/destination IP blacklists and validated behavior across 7 integration tests

**MEV Searcher (Creative Integrated Design 2)**
Spring 2025
- Designed a non-toxic MEV searcher that captures arbitrage opportunities between Uniswap V3 (DEX) and Binance (CEX)
- Developed a TypeScript + Node.js collector module to fetch and log real-time price data from both DEX and CEX APIs
- Built a TypeScript + Node.js simulator that mocks price feeds and order execution to validate strategy performance under realistic conditions

**Memory Allocator in C (System Programming Course)**  
Fall 2024 
- Implemented an efficient malloc/free system using a doubly-linked list and size-based binning strategy  
- Optimized allocation and deallocation for performance in fragmented heaps

**Custom DBMS using Berkeley DB and Python (Database Course)**  
Fall 2024  
- Built a mini DBMS supporting SQL syntax  
- Designed and implemented query parsing and execution

**HumphreysTaxi – Full-Stack Web App**  
Spring 2024  
- Designed and developed a taxi sharing platform using Next.js, Spring Boot, and AI-assisted UI features  
- Deployed the application in a production environment during military service

## Experience

**R&D Engineer Intern - RideFlux Inc.**

Seoul, South Korea | Jul – Aug 2025
- Project: LineMap
- Goal: Separate lane markings (lines) as an independent data structure within HD maps, and build a semi-automated generation pipeline with editing tools.
- Applied post-processing algorithms to deep learning model–generated line point clouds, producing polyline-based line maps.
- Developed a RViz–based editing tool for interactive line map refinement.
- Designed and implemented evaluation algorithms to measure the accuracy of automatically generated line drafts against ground truth.
- Built an editor for inserting road connection information, enabling the construction of higher-level HD maps.
